# Compose Compatibility

incus-compose implements a subset of the Compose Specification. This doc lists what works and what doesn't.

## Supported Features

### Incus Override File

If a `compose.incus.yaml` file exists next to the selected `compose.yaml`, incus-compose loads it automatically as an additional Compose file. Use it for Incus-specific overrides while keeping the upstream Docker Compose file unchanged.

```text
compose.yaml
compose.incus.yaml
```

Example `compose.incus.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    ports: !reset []
    x-incus:
      limits.memory: 512MB

networks:
  default:
    x-incus:
      ipv4.address: 10.100.0.2/24
      ipv4.gateway: 10.100.0.1
```

Running with the base file also applies the Incus override when present:

```bash
incus-compose -f compose.yaml up
```

The override file follows normal Compose merge rules. For example, `!reset []` clears a list from the base file.

### Services

- `image` - OCI images from any registry
- `command` - Override container command
- `working_dir` - Set working directory
- `user` - Run the container process as a specific UID/GID (numeric only, see below)
- `environment` - Environment variables
- `labels` - Metadata (stored as `user.label.*` config, see below)
- `depends_on` - Service dependency order
- `networks` - Multiple networks per service
- `ports` - Port publishing
- `volumes` - Named volumes and bind mounts
- `deploy.replicas` - Service scaling (instances named `{service}-{index}`)
- `restart` - Restart policies (`no`, `always`, `on-failure`, `unless-stopped`)
- `x-incus` extension — pass any Incus project, network and instance option directly (see below)
- Top-level `x-incus-compose.healthd` — configure the ic-healthd sidecar's network and Incus endpoint (see below)

#### Labels

Compose `labels` are stored on the instance as `user.label.<key>` config keys.
Both the map and list forms work:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    labels:
      caddy: whoami.example.com
      caddy.reverse_proxy: "{{upstreams 80}}"
  api:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.api.rule=Host(`api.example.com`)"
```

becomes:

```yaml
config:
  user.label.caddy: whoami.example.com
  user.label.caddy.reverse_proxy: "{{upstreams 80}}"
  user.label.traefik.http.routers.api.rule: "Host(`api.example.com`)"
```

Two labels are always added:

| Key                                | Value                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `user.label.incus-compose.project` | the compose project name |
| `user.label.incus-compose.service` | the compose service name |

Read them back with the `incus` passthrough:

```bash
incus-compose incus config get app-1 user.label.caddy
```

**Service discovery** — the `user.label.` prefix keeps compose labels out of the
`user.*` namespace incus-compose uses for its own keys, and mirrors the label
conventions of reverse proxies and DNS managers:

- [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) — `traefik.enable`, `traefik.http.routers.<name>.rule`, ...
- [caddy-docker-proxy](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) — `caddy`, `caddy.reverse_proxy`
- [dnsweaver](https://maxfield-allison.github.io/dnsweaver/) — reads the Traefik router labels above

> None of these tools support incus-compose yet: they discover services over the
> Docker socket, not the Incus API. incus-compose only exposes the labels as
> `user.label.*` instance config; consuming them needs an Incus-aware discovery
> integration.

_Changed in 1.0.0-rc.2_: labels moved from `user.<key>` to `user.label.<key>`, and the
`incus-compose.project` / `incus-compose.service` labels were added.

#### User

The `user` attribute overrides the user the container process runs as, mapping to
the image's `oci.uid` / `oci.gid`:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    user: "1000:1001" # UID:GID; the GID is optional
```

incus-compose accepts only **numeric** values in `UID` or `UID:GID` form. Usernames
and group names (e.g. `nginx` or `nginx:www-data`) are not resolved and will fail.

> The [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/05-services.md#user)
> only says `user` "overrides the user used to run the container process" and does
> not document a value format. The `UID:GID` form is Docker's convention; we follow
> it but restrict it to numeric IDs because there is no image passwd/group lookup at
> translation time.

_Since: 1.0.0-beta.22_

#### x-incus Instance Extensions

Any Incus instance config key can be set via the `x-incus` extension block on a service definition. Keys are passed verbatim to the Incus instance config on creation.

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    x-incus:
      limits.memory: 512MB
      limits.cpu: "2"
      security.privileged: "true"
```

Any [Incus instance option](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/instance_options/) is accepted.

#### x-incus-compose Devices

Attach raw Incus devices to a service's instances with the `x-incus-compose.devices`
block. Each named entry is passed to Incus verbatim; the `type` key selects the
device type and is required.

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    x-incus-compose:
      devices:
        gpu0:
          type: gpu
          gputype: physical
          pci: "0000:01:00.0"
        extra-disk:
          type: disk
          source: /dev/sdb
          path: /mnt/data
```

This is an escape hatch for device types incus-compose does not model natively
(`gpu`, `unix-char`, `usb`, ...). Compose-managed devices (`ports`, `volumes`,
`networks`) should use their native keys. Any
[Incus device](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/devices/) is
accepted; keys collide by device name, so a raw device sharing a name with a
compose-managed one overrides it.

_Since 1.0.0-beta.22_

### Projects

```yaml
x-incus:
  limits.cpu: "4"
  limits.memory: 2049MB # +1 MiB
  limits.virtual-machines: 0

services:
  web:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    deploy:
      replicas: 4
    x-incus:
      limits.cpu: "1"
      limits.memory: 512MB
```

Any [Project option](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/projects/) is accepted.

#### x-incus-compose Healthd

Configure the ic-healthd sidecar's network and Incus endpoint with the top-level
`x-incus-compose.healthd` extension:

```yaml
x-incus-compose:
  healthd:
    incus: https://:8443
    network: :default

services:
  web:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
```

`network` is `<project>:<network>` for a managed network or a plain bridge name;
`incus` is the API URL healthd connects to. Both default to the project's own
network and the connection's port. The same values are available as
`--healthd-network`/`--healthd-incus` (CLI overrides the compose file). See
[Health Checking - Network Configuration](/healthd#network-configuration).

When this option is set, incus-compose does not create compose-managed Incus network resources for service network attachments. Instances use the network devices provided by the copied profile instead. Service-level static IP assignments (`ipv4_address` / `ipv6_address`) are not supported in this mode because incus-compose does not create explicit NIC devices.

### Networks

- Bridge networks (Incus default)
- Network isolation between services
- DNS resolution by service name and by instance name
- External networks (pre-existing Incus networks)
- `x-incus` extension — pass any Incus network config key directly (see below)
- Automatic DHCP range configuration on creation (see below)
- Static IP assignment per service via `ipv4_address` / `ipv6_address` (see below)
- Default gateway selection via `x-incus-compose.gateway` on a service network attachment (see below)

Not supported:

- Custom network drivers

#### x-incus Network Extensions

Any Incus network config key can be set via the `x-incus` extension block on a network definition. Keys are passed verbatim to the Incus network config on creation.

```yaml
networks:
  backend:
    x-incus:
      ipv4.address: 10.100.0.1/24
      ipv6.address: fd42:abc::1/64
      ipv4.dhcp.ranges: 10.100.0.100-10.100.0.200
```

Any [Incus bridge network option](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/network_bridge/) is accepted.

#### External Networks

Mark a network as `external: true` to attach services to a pre-existing Incus network.
incus-compose will never create or delete an external network.

```yaml
networks:
  shared:
    external: true
```

**Name resolution** — incus-compose probes the following candidates in order and uses
the first one that exists in Incus:

1. `x-incus-compose.network` value — raw (literal)
2. `x-incus-compose.network` value — sanitized (`{project}-{name}` / hash)
3. Compose network name — raw
4. Compose network name — sanitized

Use `x-incus-compose.network` when the Incus network name does not follow the compose
naming convention:

```yaml
networks:
  frontend:
    external: true
    x-incus-compose:
      network: my-production-net # tried as-is first, then sanitized
```

If none of the candidates match an existing network, `up` fails with a not-found error.

#### Automatic DHCP Ranges

When a managed bridge network is created, incus-compose automatically configures DHCP ranges if they are not already set:

**IPv4** — The first quarter of the address block is reserved for static assignment. The DHCP range starts at that boundary:

| Subnet | Static range   | DHCP range       |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
| /24    | `.1–.63`       | `.64–.254`       |
| /16    | `.0.0–.63.255` | `.64.0–.255.254` |
| /28    | `.1–.3`        | `.4–.14`         |

**IPv6** — The first 256 addresses (`::0–::ff`) are reserved for static; DHCP runs from `::100` to `::ffff`. Stateful DHCPv6 (`ipv6.dhcp.stateful`) is enabled automatically.

Setting `ipv4.dhcp.ranges` or `ipv6.dhcp.ranges` in `x-incus` disables auto-calculation for that protocol. Existing networks (already present in Incus when `up` runs) are never modified.

#### Static IP Assignment

A service can be assigned a fixed IP on a specific network using the standard Compose
`ipv4_address` / `ipv6_address` fields on the per-service network attachment:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: docker.io/postgres:16-alpine
    networks:
      backend:
        ipv4_address: 10.100.0.10
        x-incus:
          ipv4.gateway: 10.100.0.1

  web:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    networks:
      backend:
        ipv4_address: 10.100.0.11
        ipv6_address: fd42:abc::11
        x-incus:
          ipv4.gateway: 10.100.0.1
          ipv6.gateway: fd42:abc::

networks:
  backend:
    x-incus:
      ipv4.address: 10.100.0.1/24
      ipv6.address: fd42:abc::1/64
      x-incus:
        ipv4.gateway: 10.100.0.1
        ipv6.gateway: fd42:abc::
```

The address is set as `ipv4.address` / `ipv6.address` on the Incus NIC device. The bridge's
built-in DHCP server reserves it so the instance always receives that address on the network.

The address must fall within the static zone (first quarter of the block) to avoid conflicts
with DHCP-assigned addresses.

It is important that you set `ipv4.gateway` / `ipv6.gateway` as well so your container can reach the internet / the lan.

#### Default Gateway Selection

When a service attaches to multiple networks, mark one attachment with
`x-incus-compose.gateway: true` to make it provide the instance's default route:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    networks:
      internal:
      public:
        x-incus-compose:
          gateway: true
```

The gateway-marked network is attached as the last NIC (highest `ethN`), and Incus
uses the last NIC's gateway as the default route. Here `internal` becomes `eth0`
and `public` becomes `eth1`. Without this flag, networks are ordered by name.

If several attachments set `gateway: true`, the alphabetically last one wins.

_Since: 1.0.0-beta.22_

### Volumes

- Named volumes (Incus custom storage volumes)
- Bind mounts (local connections only)
- Read-only volumes
- Automatic UID/GID shifting
- tmpfs mounts (with optional size limit)
- `x-incus` extension — pass any Incus volume config key directly (see below)
- `x-incus-compose.pool` — select the storage pool for a named volume (see below)

Not supported:

- Volume driver options

#### x-incus Volume Extensions

Any Incus storage volume config key can be set via the `x-incus` extension block on a volume definition. Keys are passed verbatim to the Incus volume config on creation.

```yaml
volumes:
  data:
    x-incus:
      size: 10GiB
      block.filesystem: ext4
```

Any [Incus storage volume option](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/storage_volumes/) is accepted.

The `x-incus` block also works inline on a volume entry, which is the only way to
set options on a **bind mount** (a bind's source is a path, not a named volume):

```yaml
services:
  web:
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./html
        target: /usr/share/nginx/html
        x-incus:
          security.shifted: "false"
```

An inline `x-incus` block takes precedence over the matching named volume
definition. See [Volume Permissions](#volume-permissions) for `security.shifted`.

#### x-incus-compose Volume Pool

Set `x-incus-compose.pool` on a named volume to place it in a specific Incus storage pool. Without this the client's default storage pool is used.

```yaml
volumes:
  data:
    x-incus-compose:
      pool: fast-ssd

services:
  app:
    image: docker.io/myapp:latest
    volumes:
      - data:/var/lib/app
```

To move an existing volume to a different pool, stop the project, then use `incus storage volume move` via the `incus-compose incus` passthrough:

```bash
incus-compose stop
incus-compose incus storage volume move default/vol-library ext/vol-library
incus-compose start
```

Then update `x-incus-compose.pool` in your compose file and run `incus-compose up --recreate` to reattach.

Volumes are stored with a `vol-` prefix. Long names are hashed, so `my-very-long-volume-name` may become `vol-a1b2c3d4...`. Use `incus storage volume list` to find the actual name before moving:

```bash
incus-compose incus storage volume list default
```

Then update `x-incus-compose.pool` in your compose file and run `incus-compose up --recreate` to reattach.

### Environment

- `.env` file loading
- `env_file` directive
- Variable interpolation
- Default values: `${VAR:-default}`
- Required variables: `${VAR?error message}`

### Project

- `name` - Project name
- Project isolation (Incus projects)
- Profiles - Compose profiles

### Build

See [Builds](/builds) for supported options, builder selection, and platform handling.

### Health Checks

Supported via the `ic-healthd` sidecar. See [Health Checking](/healthd) for full details,
including config keys, defaults, security model, and `healthd` management commands.

The healthcheck status (`starting`, `healthy`, `unhealthy`) is reported in the `Status` column of
`incus-compose list` and `incus-compose ps` when healthchecks are configured.

### Resource Limits

`deploy.resources` is not mapped. Use `x-incus` to set Incus instance limits directly:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    x-incus:
      limits.cpu: "1"
      limits.memory: 512MB
```

Any Incus instance config key is accepted. See [Architecture](/architecture#x-incus-raw-incus-options) for full details.

### Restart Policies

Restart policies map to Incus boot configuration:

| Compose `restart` | Incus Config                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `no` (default)    | `boot.autostart=false`                         |
| `always`          | `boot.autostart=true`                          |
| `on-failure`      | `boot.autostart=true`, `boot.autorestart=true` |
| `unless-stopped`  | Uses last-state behavior (Incus default)       |

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    restart: always
```

Restart enforcement is handled by the ic-healthd sidecar, including
`restart` without a healthcheck — see [Health Checking](/healthd#restart-without-a-test).

### Secrets

- `secrets` - File-based secrets pushed into container at `/run/secrets/{name}`
- `secrets[].file` - Read secret from file
- `secrets[].environment` - Read secret from environment variable
- Service `secrets[].target` - Custom target path
- Service `secrets[].uid` / `secrets[].gid` - File ownership
- Service `secrets[].mode` - File permissions (default: 0400)

### Configs

- `configs` - Config files pushed into the container at `/{name}` by default
- `configs[].file` - Read config from a file
- `configs[].content` - Inline content in the compose file
- `configs[].environment` - Read config from an environment variable
- Service `configs[].target` - Custom target path
- Service `configs[].uid` / `configs[].gid` - File ownership
- Service `configs[].mode` - File permissions (default: `0444`); the writable
  bit is always ignored, per the compose-spec, even if an explicit mode with
  a write bit is set

```yaml
configs:
  app_config:
    file: ./app_config.txt

services:
  app:
    configs:
      - app_config
      - source: app_config
        target: /etc/app/config.txt
        uid: "1000"
        gid: "1000"
        mode: 0o440
```

## Not Supported (Yet)

### External Secrets and Configs

`secrets[].external` and `configs[].external` are not supported.

In Docker Swarm, `external: true` means "this secret/config already exists —
don't create it, just reference it by name." You'd pre-create it once (e.g.
`docker secret create db_password ./password.txt`), and any number of
stacks/services could then point at that same object, so rotating it means
updating the one external secret rather than every compose file that uses it.

incus-compose has no equivalent standalone "secret" or "config" resource in
Incus to reference — it only knows how to read a `file`, inline `content`, or
an `environment` variable and push the result into a container as a file.
There's nothing in Incus for `external` to point _at_, so it's not a missing
mapping to fill in later, it's a concept without a target. Use `file`,
`content` (configs only), or `environment` instead.

### Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK

The `HEALTHCHECK` instruction embedded in Docker images is not read — declare
`healthcheck.test` explicitly in the compose file.
See [healthd.md](/healthd#dockerfile-healthcheck-not-supported) for the background.

### Extended Features

Not supported:

- `extends` - Service extension
- `deploy` - Most deployment options (except `replicas`)
- `links` - Legacy linking (use networks)
- `external_links` - Cross-project links

## Local vs Remote Incus

> **The Incus server must have `core.https_address` set in all cases** — even for
> a local Unix-socket client. Image caching copies images between Incus projects
> using pull mode, which requires the server to be reachable over the network.
> Without it, `up` fails with `The source server isn't listening on the network`.
> See [Getting Started](/getting-started#incus-must-listen-on-the-network-required).

With that in place, a few behaviors still depend on whether incus-compose talks
to a local Incus over the Unix socket or to a remote daemon over HTTPS:

| Feature       | Local (Unix socket)              | Remote (HTTPS)                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Bind mounts   | Supported                        | Not supported — use named volumes                 |
| Health checks | Set `--healthd-incus` explicitly | Auto (reuses the connection's port and bridge IP) |

Bind mounts read the host filesystem the daemon runs on, so they only work when
that host is your machine. For health checks, ic-healthd reaches Incus over
HTTPS; over a Unix socket there is no port to reuse, so the endpoint must be set
explicitly — see [Network Configuration](/healthd#network-configuration).

## Behavioral Differences

### Images

**Registries must be Incus remotes:**

Image names work just like Docker — a bare `nginx:alpine` resolves to
`docker.io/library/nginx:alpine`, and an explicit registry prefix
(`ghcr.io/...`) is honored as-is. The difference is that the registry must be
configured as an Incus remote first:

```bash
incus remote add --protocol oci docker.io https://docker.io
incus remote add --protocol oci ghcr.io https://ghcr.io
```

```yaml
# Both work, identical to Docker Compose
image: nginx:alpine # resolves to docker.io/library/nginx:alpine
image: ghcr.io/myorg/app:v1 # explicit registry
```

**Global cache:**

Like Docker, images are cached globally. An image pulled for one project is available to all projects. This avoids duplicate downloads.

**Registry authentication:**

Docker uses `~/.docker/config.json`. Incus uses remote configuration:

```bash
incus remote add --protocol oci docker.io https://docker.io --auth-type bearer
```

See [Incus documentation](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/images_remote/) for details.

**Platform selection:**

Docker allows `--platform linux/amd64`. incus-compose uses the host architecture automatically. Multi-arch images select the correct variant.

### Port Publishing

**Docker Compose:**

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:80" # iptables NAT rule
```

**incus-compose:**

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:80" # Incus proxy device
```

Both work the same from outside. By default incus-compose uses userspace proxy devices (a Go
process per forwarded connection). For high-throughput services you can opt in to kernel-mode NAT
via a service extension, which installs nftables DNAT rules instead:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      - frontend
    x-incus-compose:
      nat-proxy:
        - port: 8080 # listen port (matches the published port above)
          connect: 80 # container port to forward to
        - port: 8443
          connect: 443
          listen: # optional: restrict listen IPs (default: all bridge IPs)
            - 192.168.1.1
```

Each `nat-proxy` entry maps one published port to a container port. `listen` is optional; when
omitted, incus-compose discovers the bridge IP(s) from the attached network and listens on all of
them.

Requirements for `nat-proxy`:

- The service must be attached to at least one managed bridge network (a plain `networks:` entry).
- If no managed NIC is present, incus-compose falls back to userspace and logs a warning.
- After a manual `incus restart` the nftables rule may become stale; use `incus-compose up` to
  reapply.

### Network Naming

**Docker Compose:**

```
{project}_{network}  # e.g., myapp_frontend
```

**incus-compose:**

```
{project}-{network}  # e.g., myapp-frontend (if ≤13 chars)
ic-{hash}            # e.g., ic-a1b2c3d4e5 (if >13 chars)
```

Network names are limited to 13 chars for dhclient compatibility.

### Volume Permissions

**Docker Compose:**

- Volumes owned by root by default
- Manual chown often needed

**incus-compose:**

- Volumes automatically shifted to match container's UID/GID
- Reads `oci.uid` and `oci.gid` from image
- Files appear with correct ownership inside container

**Disabling shifting (`security.shifted: "false"`):**

Shifting maps host files to the container's UID/GID so they appear correctly
owned. Set `security.shifted: "false"` via `x-incus` to turn it off, e.g. for a
read-only bind mount you don't want re-owned. Without shifting, the host file
keeps its raw host UID/GID inside the container, which for an unprivileged
container outside the idmap range shows up as `nobody` (65534):

```yaml
services:
  web:
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./html
        target: /usr/share/nginx/html
        read_only: true
        x-incus:
          security.shifted: "false"
```

```console
$ ls -ln /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 65534 65534 18 ... index.html
```

For a bind mount this must be set inline on the volume entry (see
[x-incus Volume Extensions](#x-incus-volume-extensions)).

### External Volumes

**Docker Compose:** an external volume must already exist — Compose will
never create it, and never removes it (not even with `down --volumes` /
equivalent), since it doesn't own the volume's lifecycle.

**incus-compose:** every named volume, external or not, goes through the same
get-or-create path — reuse the Incus storage volume if it already exists,
create it if it doesn't. There's no tracking of "this one was pre-existing."
Concretely, that means:

- A typo'd or renamed volume that would fail fast under Docker (volume not
  found) instead silently creates a new, empty volume here.
- `incus-compose down --volumes` deletes every storage volume tracked for the
  project, including ones marked `external: true` — there's no protection
  against removing a volume you intended to be pre-existing and shared with
  something else.

If you need to reference a real pre-existing Incus storage volume without
risking it being deleted, avoid `down --volumes` for that project, or manage
the volume directly with `incus storage volume` outside of compose.

### Instance Naming

Instances are named `{service}-{index}` where index starts at 1:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: docker.io/nginx:alpine
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
```

Creates instances: `web-1`, `web-2`, `web-3`

You can also override replicas via CLI:

```bash
incus-compose up --scale web=5
```

`--scale` applies only to that invocation. Like `docker compose up`, a plain `up`
reconciles each service back to `deploy.replicas` in both directions: it recreates
instances removed by an earlier `--scale` and tears down extras added by one. Use
`--scale` (or edit `deploy.replicas`) to change the persistent count.

### DNS Resolution

After `up`, both the **service name** and the **instance name** resolve inside containers:

```
database    → round-robins across all database instances (A/AAAA records)
database-1  → specific instance (registered by Incus dnsmasq)
```

This matches Docker Compose behavior. No configuration is required — records are
written automatically to the project bridge network's `raw.dnsmasq` and updated
whenever the scale changes.

**Note:** Setting `raw.dnsmasq` on the bridge disables AppArmor for the dnsmasq
process (not for containers). dnsmasq still runs as an unprivileged user.

### Environment Variables

**Docker Compose:**

```bash
export MY_VAR=value
docker-compose up  # MY_VAR available
```

**incus-compose:**

```bash
export MY_VAR=value
incus-compose up  # MY_VAR NOT available (security)
```

Use `.env` files or `--os-env` flag for docker-compose compatibility.

## Testing Compatibility

To test if your compose file works:

```bash
# Validate syntax
incus-compose config --quiet

# Show what will be created
incus-compose config

# Try starting
incus-compose up --no-start

# Check what was created
incus-compose list
```

## Reporting Compatibility Issues

If you find a compose feature that should work but doesn't, please report it with:

1. Minimal `compose.yaml` that reproduces the issue
2. Expected behavior (what docker-compose does)
3. Actual behavior (what incus-compose does)
4. Incus version: `incus version`
