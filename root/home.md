# incus-compose

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/1259458.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/1259458)

## Why incus-compose?

[Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) provides powerful system containers and virtual machines with superior security and isolation, but lacks the declarative multi-container orchestration that Docker Compose offers. This tool bridges that gap:

- Use existing `docker-compose.yml` files with Incus containers
- Leverage Incus's native OCI registry support for image pulling
- Run Docker/OCI images directly from registries
- Manage complex multi-container applications with familiar commands
- Benefit from Incus's resource efficiency and security model

## Features

Status: **Beta** - testing the beta release of incus-compose.

- Familiar commands: `up`, `down`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `list` (and `ps`), `logs`, `exec`, `config`, plus `build`, `healthd`, `incus` (pass-through), and `self-update`
- Compose project parsing via compose-go, with automatic `compose.incus.yaml` overrides and `x-incus` / `x-incus-compose` extensions for raw Incus options
- OCI image pulling from docker.io, ghcr.io, and other registries
- Two-stage image cache in a dedicated Incus project (survives `down`/`up`, avoids registry rate limits)
- Local image building via Podman/Docker [doc](/docs/v1/builds)
- Bridge networks with automatic name sanitization
- Static IPv4/IPv6 addresses with automatic DHCP ranges [doc](/docs/v1/compose-compatibility#automatic-dhcp-ranges)
- Port forwarding via proxy devices or kernel NAT mode [doc](/docs/v1/compose-compatibility#port-publishing)
- Storage volumes with UID/GID shifting; bind mounts (pass-through by default, optional seeding) [doc](/docs/v1/compose-compatibility#volume-permissions)
- Health checks, restart policies, and `depends_on: service_healthy` ordering via the `ic-healthd` sidecar [doc](/docs/v1/healthd)
- Service scaling with `up --scale` and orphan pruning
- Incus project isolation
- Resource limits and other advanced compose features (`shm_size`, `container_name`, etc.)
- Configuration via `INCUS_COMPOSE_*` environment variables for every flag, with a configurable parallel worker count [doc](/docs/v1/environment-variables)

## Quick Start

Requires `podman` or `docker` for image building and an Incus https remote (needed for healthchecking) with OCI registries added.
See [Getting Started](/docs/v1/getting-started) for the full setup walkthrough.

Install the latest release (the script verifies the SHA-256 checksum):

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxc/incus-compose/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b ~/.local/bin
```

Or grab a prebuilt archive from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/lxc/incus-compose/releases).

Then point it at your existing `compose.yaml`:

```bash
# Start services
incus-compose up

# View logs
incus-compose logs -f

# List running services
incus-compose list

# Stop and remove
incus-compose down
```
