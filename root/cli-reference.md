Supports [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/) via a `NO_COLOR` env var.

### Disabling the Cache

Set `--image-cache ""` (or `INCUS_COMPOSE_IMAGE_CACHE=""`) to skip the cache
project and pull images straight into each project instead. This trades the
shared cache (and its rate-limit/re-pull savings) for one fewer copy per
image - useful if you don't want a persistent cache project on the server at
all.

## up

Create and start containers.

```
incus-compose up [SERVICE...]
```

| Option                 | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d`, `--detach`       | Detached mode: run containers in the background                                                                                   |

| `--no-start`           | Don't start containers after creating                                                                                             |
| `--pull`               | Pull policy: `always` (refresh from registry), `missing`/`policy` (use cache if present), `never` (never pull); default: `policy` |
| `--build`              | Rebuild build-configured service images before starting containers                                                                |
| `--no-build`           | Do not build images; fail if a required built image is missing                                                                    |
| `--builder`            | Preferred builder, binary name or absolute path (`INCUS_COMPOSE_BUILDER`); empty for auto-detect                                  |
| `--no-deps`            | Don't start linked services (depends_on)                                                                                          |
| `--timeout`            | Stop/start timeout (default: 1m)                                                                                                  |
| `--dependency-timeout` | Max time to wait for `service_healthy` depends_on (default: 5m; `0` = no limit)                                                   |

| `--external-healthd`   | Use an existing (unmanaged) healthd; don't create or look one up                                                                  |
| `--healthd-image`      | Healthd OCI image (`INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_IMAGE`); `{version}` is replaced with the incus-compose version                         |
| `--healthd-binary`     | Path to local ic-healthd binary (uses images:alpine/edge instead of OCI image)                                                    |

| `--healthd-network`    | Network for healthd (`INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_NETWORK`); overrides `x-incus-compose.healthd.network`; project default if unset      |

Without `--detach`, `up` streams logs from all started services (equivalent to running `logs --follow` immediately after). Use `--detach` to return as soon as containers are started.

For services with `build:`, `up` builds missing images by default. Use `--build` to force a rebuild or `--no-build` to require the image to already exist. See [Builds](/builds) for details.

## build

Build or rebuild service images for services that define `build:`.

```
incus-compose build [SERVICE...]
```

| Option       | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `--no-cache` | Do not use cache when building the image              |
| `--pull`     | Always attempt to pull a newer version of base images |

When service names are provided, only matching build-configured services are built. Services without `build:` are skipped. Built images are imported into the Incus project and used by `up`.

See [Builds](/builds): for supported Compose build options and requirements.

## down

Stop and remove containers. Per-project image copies are removed too; volumes and
the image cache are kept. Use `--volumes` to also delete volumes while keeping the
project, or `--project` to remove everything (project and volumes).

```
incus-compose down [SERVICE...]
```

| Option               | Description                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--project`          | Remove the project (and its volumes)                                     |
| `--volumes`          | Also delete volumes, but keep the project                                |
| `--rmi`              | Remove images used by services: `local` or `all` (docker compose compat) |
| `--images`           | Remove known images from the project (equivalent to `--rmi local`)       |
| `--timeout`          | Stop timeout (default: 10s)                                              |
| `--no-deps`          | Don't stop linked services (depends_on)                                  |
| `--no-networks`      | Don't touch networks                                                     |
| `--external-healthd` | Use an existing (unmanaged) healthd; don't look one up                   |
| `--no-healthd`       | Don't stop/remove healthd sidecar                                        |

*Changed in 1.0.0-rc.1*: `--volumes` is now no more an alias for `--project` but deletes volumes.

## start

Start stopped services.

```
incus-compose start [SERVICE...]
```

| Option         | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--timeout`    | Start timeout (default: 1m)                                       |
| `--with-deps`  | Also start linked services (depends_on) — incus-compose extension |
| `--no-healthd` | Don't start healthd sidecar                                       |

## stop

Stop running services.

```
incus-compose stop [SERVICE...]
```

| Option         | Description                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--timeout`    | Stop timeout (default: 10s)                                      |
| `--with-deps`  | Also stop linked services (depends_on) — incus-compose extension |
| `--no-healthd` | Don't stop healthd sidecar                                       |

## restart

Restart running services.

```
incus-compose restart [SERVICE...]
```

| Option         | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `--with-deps`  | Also restart linked services (depends_on) — incus-compose extension |
| `--no-healthd` | Don't stop/start healthd sidecar                                    |

### Linked services

`up` and `down` follow `depends_on` by default: naming a service pulls in the
services it links to (its dependencies on `up`, its dependents on `down`). Use
`--no-deps` to act on exactly the named services. On `up`, `--no-deps` also
skips waiting on `depends_on: { condition: service_healthy }` for the
out-of-scope dependencies, so the named service starts without them.

`start`, `stop`, `restart`, `logs`, and `ps` act on exactly the named services
by default, matching `docker compose start`/`stop`. The `--with-deps` flag is an
incus-compose extension that opts those commands into following `depends_on` the
same way `up`/`down` do.

## logs

View container output.

```
incus-compose logs [SERVICE...]
```

| Option           | Description                                                                |

| `--with-deps`    | Also show logs from linked services (depends_on) — incus-compose extension |

Missing instances are skipped with a warning; logs from available instances are still shown.

## config

Validate and render compose file.

```
incus-compose config [SERVICE...]
```

| Option           | Description                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `--format`       | yaml (default) or json                   |
| `-q`, `--quiet`  | Validate only                            |

| `--networks`     | List networks                            |
| `--profiles`     | List profiles                            |
| `--images`       | List images                              |

| `--variables`    | Print model variables and default values |
| `-o`, `--output` | Save to file                             |

## exec

Execute a command in a running instance.

```
incus-compose exec [options] SERVICE COMMAND [ARGS...]
```

| Option            | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d`, `--detach`  | Run command in the background                                          |
| `--dry-run`       | Execute command in dry run mode                                        |
| `-e`, `--env`     | Set environment variables `KEY=VALUE` (repeatable)                     |
| `--index`         | Index of the container if service has multiple replicas (default: 0)   |
| `-T`, `--no-tty`  | Disable pseudo-TTY allocation                                          |
| `--privileged`    | Give extended privileges to the process (accepted but not implemented) |
| `-u`, `--user`    | Run the command as this user (default: the instance's UID)             |
| `-g`, `--group`   | Run the command as this group (default: the instance's GID)            |
| `-w`, `--workdir` | Path to workdir directory for this command                             |

`exec` shells out to your local `incus` client and targets the instance via
`INCUS_PROJECT`. It uses your local Incus remote configuration (`incus remote` /
`INCUS_REMOTE`), not a connection configured through `INCUS_COMPOSE_URL`.

Like `docker compose exec`, the command runs as the instance's user and group by
default — the image's `oci.uid` / `oci.gid`, or the numeric IDs from the service
[`user:`](/compose-compatibility#user) override. Pass `--user` / `--group` to run
as someone else:

```bash
incus-compose exec web id             # runs as the instance's user (e.g. 1000:1000)
incus-compose exec --user 0 web id    # runs as root
```

The command and its arguments are passed to Incus verbatim, so flags with leading
dashes work without escaping:

```bash
incus-compose exec web ls -ln /data
incus-compose exec web sh -c 'echo hello > /data/test.txt'
```

*Changed in 1.0.0-beta.22*: exec uses the instances UID/GID by default.

## ps

## incus

Run any `incus` command scoped to the current compose project. All flags and arguments are passed through verbatim; only `INCUS_PROJECT` is injected.

```
incus-compose incus COMMAND [ARGS...]
```

Examples:

```bash
incus-compose incus list                        # list instances in this project
incus-compose incus config show web-1           # show instance config
incus-compose incus config set web-1 limits.memory 512MB
incus-compose incus exec web-1 -- bash
```

Equivalent to `INCUS_PROJECT=<project> incus COMMAND [ARGS...]`.

## healthd

Manage the ic-healthd sidecar. See [Health Checking](/healthd) for full details.

```
incus-compose healthd <subcommand>
```

| Subcommand        | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `logs [--follow]` | Stream the ic-healthd container log   |
| `reload`          | Send SIGHUP to the ic-healthd process |
| `restart`         | Restart the ic-healthd container      |
| `up [--recreate]` | Create or recreate the sidecar        |
| `down`            | Stop and remove the sidecar           |

`healthd up` also accepts `--image`, `--binary`, `--incus`, and `--network`. See
[Health Checking - Network Configuration](/healthd#network-configuration).

## list

List project resources.

```
incus-compose list [SERVICE...]
```

| Option         | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--format`     | table (default), yaml, json                       |
| `--no-healthd` | Exclude the ic-healthd sidecar from the output    |

The `IMAGE` column shows the compose image for each service. The ic-healthd sidecar is listed by default; its image is resolved from the instance's stored metadata. Pass `--no-healthd` to omit it.

*Changed in 1.0.0-rc.1*: healthd is listed by default.

## version

Print the incus-compose version.

```
incus-compose version
```

## self-update

Update incus-compose to the latest release from GitHub.

```
incus-compose self-update
```

| Option         | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `--draft`     | Also consider draft releases when checking for updates (works only with GITHUB_TOKEN set) |
| `--pre-release` | Also consider pre-releases when checking for updates |

This command is only available when both conditions are met:

1. The binary was built with a release version (not `latest` / development builds)
2. The binary file is writable by the current user

When available, `self-update` checks the [lxc/incus-compose](https://github.com/lxc/incus-compose) GitHub releases for a newer version matching the current OS and architecture. If a newer version is found, the binary is replaced in-place. If you are already on the latest version, no action is taken.

*Changed v1.0.0: the `--drafts` option has been added*

## Docker Compose command parity

Most `docker compose` verbs map directly. Anything without a dedicated command is
reachable through the `incus-compose incus` passthrough, which runs any `incus`
command scoped to the current project.
