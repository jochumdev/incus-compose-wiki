# Health Checking (ic-healthd)

incus-compose implements health checks via a sidecar container called `ic-healthd`.
Incus has no native healthcheck support, so ic-healthd fills that role.

> **ic-healthd is a core component.** Every `healthcheck`, every restart policy
> (`restart: always | on-failure | unless-stopped`), and every
> `depends_on: { condition: service_healthy }` is enforced by this sidecar, not by
> Incus. If healthd is misconfigured, stopped, or crashing:
>
> - instances are not restarted, and
> - **the project may fail to come up at all**: `incus-compose up` waits for
>   `service_healthy` dependencies to be reported healthy by healthd. If that
>   status never arrives, `up` blocks until `--dependency-timeout` (default 5m;
>   `0` waits forever) and then fails.
>
> Opt out of healthd entirely with `incus-compose up --no-healthd` (this also
> drops the dependency wait); `--no-deps` skips the wait too. When health,
> restart, or startup-ordering behavior looks wrong, debug healthd first (see
> [Debugging ic-healthd](#debugging-ic-healthd)).

## How It Works

`incus-compose up` creates the sidecar when any service declares a `healthcheck`,
has a restart policy other than `no`, or is depended on with `condition: service_healthy`.
It then:

1. Resolves the Incus bridge healthd should attach to (see [Network Configuration](#network-configuration)).
2. Creates a restricted Incus trust token scoped to the project.
3. Starts the `ic-healthd` sidecar, attaches it to the bridge, and injects the token (plus the Incus API URL and project) as environment variables.
4. ic-healthd authenticates once (token consumed) and persists the resulting cert.
5. ic-healthd discovers which instances to watch by reading the Incus API.
6. ic-healthd runs the health loop and writes the result to `user.healthcheck.status`.

The sidecar starts before the regular services so `service_healthy` dependencies
can be evaluated, and is removed by `incus-compose down`.

## Config Storage

Health check config and runtime state live in the instance's `user.*` config keys.
There is no separate config file. ic-healthd reads these keys at startup and on
SIGHUP (`incus-compose healthd reload`).

See the Docker healthcheck docs for the value semantics: https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile#healthcheck

```
user.healthcheck.test            '["CMD","wget","-q","--spider","http://localhost"]'
user.healthcheck.start_period    10s
user.healthcheck.start_interval  2s
user.healthcheck.interval        10s
user.healthcheck.timeout         5s
user.healthcheck.retries         3
user.healthcheck.status          starting | healthy | unhealthy
user.restart                     always | on-failure | unless-stopped
```

These keys are visible in `incus config show <instance>`.

`user.healthcheck.status` is the only key ic-healthd writes back; all others are
set by incus-compose at instance creation time and treated as read-only by the
daemon. incus-compose sets the initial status to `starting`.

## Defaults

When keys are missing, ic-healthd falls back to:

| Key            | Default       |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| start_period   | 0s (disabled) |
| start_interval | 5s            |
| interval       | 30s           |
| timeout        | 30s           |
| retries        | 3             |

`retries` must be greater than 0.

After `retries` consecutive failures the instance is restarted. The first
restart waits `interval * retries`; the delay doubles on every further restart,
capped at 5 minutes.

## Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK Not Supported

incus-compose does not read or inherit the `HEALTHCHECK` instruction embedded in Docker images.

Incus imports OCI images via umoci, which converts the OCI image config into an
OCI runtime spec. The Docker `HEALTHCHECK` extension is not part of the OCI image
spec and is discarded during that conversion. Fetching it from the registry at
`up` time would require registry access on every run and fails in air-gapped
environments.

**Workaround:** Always declare `healthcheck.test` explicitly in the compose file:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: docker.io/postgres:16-alpine
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "postgres"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
```

## Restart Without a Test

`restart: always`, `on-failure`, or `unless-stopped` without a `healthcheck`
block is also handled. ic-healthd monitors the instance state and restarts it
when stopped, without running an exec-based test command.

With `unless-stopped`, instances stopped intentionally (`user.healthcheck.stopped=true`,
set by `incus-compose stop`) are not restarted.

## Network Configuration

ic-healthd runs in its own container and must reach the Incus HTTPS API from the
inside. Two things are configured:

- **`network`** - the Incus network (or host bridge) healthd attaches its NIC to.
- **`incus`** - the Incus API URL healthd connects to.

Both can be set in the compose file or overridden on the CLI. CLI flags and
environment variables take priority over the compose file.

```yaml
name: my-project
x-incus-compose:
  healthd:
    # Incus API endpoint healthd connects to.
    # Default: the bridge IP of `network` below, with the port incus-compose
    # itself connected on.
    incus: https://<ip-of-the-projects-bridge>:8443
    # `<project>:<network>` for a managed network, or a plain bridge name.
    # We assume the current project if you leave the first part empty.
    # Default: the `default` network of the current project.
    network: :default
```

| Flag                | Environment variable            | Compose key                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `--healthd-incus`   | `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_INCUS`   | `x-incus-compose.healthd.incus`   |
| `--healthd-network` | `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_NETWORK` | `x-incus-compose.healthd.network` |

`incus-compose healthd up` takes the same two options as `--incus` and `--network`.

### `network`

- **Empty (default)** - the `default` network of the current project. incus-compose
  creates it if needed, so healthd can come up before the rest of the project.
- **`<project>:<network>`** - a managed Incus network, optionally in another
  project. It must already exist; incus-compose never creates it.
- **A value without `:`** - a host bridge name (e.g. `incusbr0`). It must already
  exist.

The network's IPv4 gateway is used as the default Incus endpoint, so healthd can
reach Incus over that bridge.

### `incus`

- **Empty (default)** - `https://<network gateway IP>:<client port>`. The port is
  the one incus-compose used for its own connection, so Incus must be listening on
  the bridge IP (commonly all interfaces, `core.https_address = :8443`). This
  requires a HTTPS connection; over a unix socket there is no port to reuse, so set
  `--healthd-incus` explicitly.
- **An explicit URL** - used verbatim, e.g. `https://10.0.0.1:8443`. Combine with
  `network` to pin both the bridge and the endpoint.

### Combinations

| `network`                  | `incus` | Behavior                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| default                    | empty   | Project bridge IP + client port (the default) |
| default                    | URL     | Project bridge for the NIC, pinned endpoint   |
| bridge / `project:network` | empty   | Different bridge, auto-detected IP            |
| bridge / `project:network` | URL     | Different bridge, pinned endpoint             |

## Security

The restricted token gives ic-healthd project-scoped access only:

- Can exec commands into instances in the project.
- Can manage instance state (start/stop/restart) within the project.
- Cannot access other projects or perform global operations.

## Management Commands

The `healthd` command group manages the sidecar directly without touching services:

| Subcommand        | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `logs [--follow]` | Stream the ic-healthd container log                   |
| `reload`          | Send SIGHUP to the ic-healthd process (reload config) |
| `restart`         | Restart the ic-healthd container                      |
| `up [--recreate]` | Create or recreate the sidecar                        |
| `down`            | Stop and remove the sidecar                           |

`healthd up` accepts `--image`, `--binary`, `--incus`, and `--network`. It refuses with an
error when no service in the project requires healthd (no healthcheck, no restart
policy, no `service_healthy` dependency).

Healthd debug logging is controlled by the global incus-compose `--debug` flag,
which is inherited by healthd operations.
Use `incus-compose --debug healthd up --recreate` to enable debug logs;
omit `--debug` to keep normal log verbosity.

## Disabling the Sidecar

```bash
incus-compose up --no-healthd
```

## Development: Local Binary

```bash
incus-compose up --healthd-binary ./bin/ic-healthd
```

Uses `images:alpine/edge` instead of the published OCI image and pushes the
local binary into the container before start. Useful when iterating on ic-healthd
itself.

## Running ic-healthd Directly

When `incus-compose up` creates the sidecar it injects the daemon's configuration
as environment variables. You can also run `ic-healthd run` yourself - as a binary
or a separately managed container, e.g. to debug against a live project - and point
incus-compose at it with `up --external-healthd` / `down --external-healthd` so
incus-compose uses healthd features but does not create or look up the sidecar.

The `run` command reads these flags, each with a matching env var (incus-compose
sets the env vars on the sidecar automatically):

| Flag            | Env var                             | Default               | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--incus`       | `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_INCUS`       | -                     | Incus API URL to connect to                                  |
| `--token`       | `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_TOKEN`       | -                     | Trust token used to register the client cert                 |
| `--project`     | `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_PROJECTS`    | -                     | Project(s) to manage (repeatable)                            |
| `--data-dir`    | `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_DATA_DIR`    | `/var/lib/ic-healthd` | Persistent directory for the generated cert/key              |
| `--secrets-dir` | `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_SECRETS_DIR` | `/etc/ic-healthd`     | Tmpfs directory holding the one-time registration token file |
| `--debug`       | `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_DEBUG`       | `false`               | Verbose logging                                              |

The token is consumed on first run: ic-healthd registers its generated client
certificate, persists the cert/key to `--data-dir`, and reuses them afterwards.
In the normal flow incus-compose supplies it via `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_TOKEN`;
when running the daemon by hand pass `--token` (or drop a token file in
`--secrets-dir`).

### Standalone on the host

The fastest edit-run-reload loop when hacking on the daemon: run `ic-healthd` on
the host and attach a project to it with `--external-healthd`.

> The daemon registers over the Incus HTTPS API, so the default remote must expose
> an HTTPS address (not just the local unix socket).

1. Build and start the daemon; the token is minted inline and passed via
   `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_TOKEN`:

   ```bash
   # The Incus project to watch (its Incus name).
   export INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_PROJECTS=many-dependencies

   mkdir -p ./work/{secrets,data}
   rm -f ./work/data/*

   # HTTPS address of the default remote.
   export INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_INCUS=$(default=$(incus remote get-default); incus remote list --format=json | jq -r '."'$default'" .Addrs[0]')
   # A restricted, project-scoped trust token.
   export INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_TOKEN="$(incus -q config trust add manual_healthd --projects=$INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_PROJECTS --restricted)"

   just build-healthd
   ./bin/ic-healthd run --debug --secrets-dir=./work/secrets/ --data-dir=./work/data/
   ```

   On first run it consumes the token and writes the cert/key to `./work/data`,
   reusing them afterwards (delete `./work/data/*` to re-register).

2. Note the PID from the startup log (or use `pidof ic-healthd`):

   ```
   time=2026-07-04T15:47:24.177+02:00 level=INFO msg=Version version=v1.0.0-beta.20-29-g57f305c-dirty pid=446206
   ```

3. In another terminal, bring the project up against the running daemon.
   `--external-healthd` makes incus-compose use healthd features without creating
   or looking up a sidecar of its own:

   ```bash
   just run -P examples/many-dependencies/ up --external-healthd
   ```

4. Reload the daemon after changing config keys by sending it SIGHUP:

   ```bash
   kill -HUP <pid-from-step-2>
   ```

## Sidecar Image

Default image: `ghcr.io/lxc/incus-compose/ic-healthd:{version}`

Override with `--healthd-image` flag or `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_IMAGE` env var.

The container is named `{project}-ic-healthd` and tagged with
`user.healthcheck.daemon=true` so ic-healthd skips itself during discovery.

## Debugging ic-healthd

Because healthd drives all health and restart behavior, most "container did not
restart" or "stuck `service_healthy`" problems are diagnosed from the sidecar.
Work through these in order.

### 1. Check the reported health status

Instances are named `<service>-1` (the replica index starts at 1) and live in the
Incus project named after your compose project, so pass `--project`. ic-healthd
writes its verdict to `user.healthcheck.status`
(`starting | healthy | unhealthy`):

```bash
incus config get web-1 user.healthcheck.status --project <project>
```

`starting` that never becomes `healthy` means the test never passes within the
start period; `unhealthy` means it failed `retries` times.

### 2. Inspect the config keys healthd reads

All inputs live in `user.healthcheck.*` (and `user.restart`). If a key is wrong,
healthd behaves wrong - it never reads the compose file directly:

```bash
incus config show web-1 --project <project> | grep -E 'user\.(healthcheck|restart)'
```

### 3. Watch the daemon logs

```bash
incus-compose healthd logs --follow
```

Enable debug logging for full per-check detail (failures, retry counts,
`inStart` transitions, restart delays). The `--debug` flag is inherited by the
sidecar, so recreate it with debug on:

```bash
incus-compose --debug healthd up --recreate
incus-compose healthd logs --follow
```

### 4. Confirm the sidecar is actually running

The container is named `{project}-ic-healthd`. If it is missing or stopped,
nothing is being monitored:

```bash
incus-compose list                    # the sidecar is listed by default (since 1.0.0-rc.1)
incus-compose healthd up --recreate   # recreate if missing/stale
```

Remember: `incus-compose start` never (re)starts the sidecar - only `up` does.

### 5. Reproduce the health test by hand

healthd runs `user.healthcheck.test` via `incus exec`. Run it yourself to see
why it fails:

```bash
incus-compose exec <service> -- sh -c 'wget -q --spider http://localhost; echo exit: $?'
```

### 6. Reload after editing keys

If you change `user.healthcheck.*` keys directly (instead of via `up`), tell the
running daemon to re-read them:

```bash
incus-compose healthd reload   # sends SIGHUP
```

### `incus-compose up` hangs or times out on dependencies

If a service uses `depends_on: { condition: service_healthy }`, `up` waits for
healthd to report the dependency `healthy` before starting the dependent service.
A broken or missing healthd means that status never arrives and `up` blocks until
`--dependency-timeout` (default 5m) elapses, then fails.

1. Confirm the dependency's status with steps 1-3 above; it is likely stuck on
   `starting` or `unhealthy`.
2. If you only want to bring the project up without the wait, opt out:

   ```bash
   incus-compose up --no-healthd   # also stops managing healthchecks/restarts
   # or keep healthd but skip the wait:
   incus-compose up --no-deps
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**Sidecar has wrong config (missing `--incus`/`--project` flags)?**

This can happen when ic-healthd was created by an older version of incus-compose.
Recreate it:

```bash
incus-compose healthd up --recreate
```

**Sidecar not running after `incus-compose start`?**

`start` never creates or starts the sidecar; only `up` does. Use
`incus-compose healthd up` to start it independently.
