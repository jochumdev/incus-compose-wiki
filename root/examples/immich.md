# Immich

Immich, a self-hosted photo and video backup solution.

The files for this example are on [Github](https://github.com/lxc/incus-compose/tree/main/examples/immich).

## The example

Five services, following [Immich's official Compose layout](https://docs.immich.app/install/docker-compose): `server`, `machine-learning`, `microservices` (background workers, split from `server` via `IMMICH_WORKERS_INCLUDE`/`EXCLUDE`), `redis`, and `database` (a Postgres fork with vector search support). Version, secrets, and storage paths come from `.env`.

## Usage

```bash
incus-compose up
```

Open http://10.131.32.17:2283/

## Notes

- `library`'s storage pool comes from `UPLOAD_POOL` in `.env` via `x-incus-compose.pool` — set it before first run.
